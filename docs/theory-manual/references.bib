The new method, denoted as the generalized-α method, possesses numerical dissipation that can be controlled by the user. In particular, it is shown that the generalized-α method achieves high-frequency dissipation while minimizing unwanted low-frequency dissipation. Comparisons are given of the generalized-α method with other numerically dissipative time integration methods; these results highlight the improved performance of the new algorithm. The new algorithm can be easily implemented into programs that already include the Newmark and Hilber-Hughes-Taylor-α time integration methods.}",

    abstract = {{\enspace}This paper presents the consistency and stability analyses of the Generalized-$\alpha$ methods applied to non-linear dynamical systems. The second-order accuracy of this class of algorithms is proved also in the non-linear regime, independently of the quadrature rule for non-linear internal forces. Conversely, the G-stability notion which is suitable for linear multistep schemes devoted to non-linear dynamic problems cannot be applied, as the non-linear structural dynamics equations are not contractive. Nonetheless, it is proved that the Generalized-$\alpha$ methods are endowed with stability in an energy sense and guarantee energy decay in the high-frequency range as well as asymptotic annihilation. However, overshoot and heavy energy oscillations in the intermediate-frequency range are exhibited. The results of representative numerical simulations performed on relatively simple single- and multiple-degrees-of-freedom non-linear systems are presented in order to confirm the analytical estimates.},

    abstract = {An adaptive time step size control strategy is presented for use with step-by-step time integration methods to solve structural dynamics problems. A simple and efficient local error estimate is derived for the newly developed generalized-α time integration method. By judicious choice of normalization, the local error estimate is related to a user-specified tolerance of desired number of time steps per period of effective system response frequency. Step size control algorithms are given that control the undesirable, frequent changes in time step size. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the performance of the local error estimate and the time step size control strategy.}

  abstract = {In ancient bows the grip of the bow was in the way of the arrow. The arrow needed to get round the bow while being accelerated; this phenomenon is called the `Archer's Paradox'. In the forties it was observed experimentally with high-speed cameras that the arrow vibrates in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the vertical median plane of the bow. These movements are started and controlled by the movements of the two points of contact with the bow, viz. the middle of the string in contact with the rear end of the arrow and the grip where the arrow slides along the bow. The latter contact imposes a moving-boundary condition. The numerically obtained results are satisfactorily in agreement with experimental data. The model can be used to estimate the drawing force of ancient bows of which only the contemporary arrows are available and also for the design of new archery equipment.},
