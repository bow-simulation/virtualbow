# Shape

Shows the shape of the limb and string as well as the position of the arrow at different stages of either the draw (statics) or the shot (dynamics).
The little red circle symbolizes the back end of the arrow.
You can use the slider at the bottom to change the current state of the bow or to view all states as a continuous animation.
