Here you can set the mass of the arrow as well as some other optional masses.

Only the mass of the arrow is actually required.
The other ones account for optional weights at various points of the bow and may be set to zero if not needed.
Masses in general only have an effect in dynamic analysis.

- **Arrow:** Mass of the arrow

- **String center:** Additional masses at the string center (e.g. serving, nocking point)

- **String tip:** Additional masses at the ends of the string (e.g. serving)

- **Limb tip:** Additional masses at the limb tips (e.g. tip overlays, extending nocks)
