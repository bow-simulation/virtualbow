# User Manual

The user manual is created with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) version 0.4.21, a tool that creates documentation from markdown files.
The following commands might be useful:

- `mdbook serve` for serving the documentation locally and update it on changes

- `mdbook build` to build the final version for deployment
