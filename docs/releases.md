# Building the Release Versions

## Windows

The Windows version is built with [MinGW-w64](https://wiki.qt.io/MinGW).
It seems to generate faster code than Microsoft Visual C++ for our use case.

The Windows installer can be built with

    cmake --build . --target iss-installer

This requires [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to be installed and added to `PATH`.

## Linux

The Linux version is built with GCC on the oldest feasible Ubuntu LTS release, currently 18.04.
(The still supported LTS release 16.04 is not feasible, because Qt >= 5.6 is needed.)
This ensures reasonable compatibility with other/older systems.
Other than Windows and MacOS, the Qt libraries used are the ones packaged with the system (e.g. `qt5-default` on Ubuntu).
This means that VirtualBow has to compile with that Qt version, which currently is Qt 5.9.5.
Other platforms are built with newer Qt versions to take advantage of any bug fixes and improvements in Qt, but may not use newer features.

The release packages are built with
    
    cmake --build . --target deb-package
    cmake --build . --target rpm-package

This requires `dpkg` and `rpmbuild` respectively.

## MacOS

The oldest MacOS version still supported by Apple is currently 10.13, which is also what the latest Qt version supports.
The CMake option `DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is used to target versions.

The release package is built with

    cmake --build . --target dmg-installer

and requires [node-appdmg](https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg) for creating the installer image.

    * Launch the application
    * Open results produced by previous simulation

* VirtualBow Solver
    * Simulate all `.bow` files of the previous version in /examples to verify compatibility

## File Actions

Described below is what should be happen when one of the file menu actions (New File, Open, Save, Save As, Quit) is performed, depending on the state of the editor (no file loaded (unmodified), no file loaded (modified), file loaded, file loaded (modified)) and the subsequent choices made by the user.

- **No file loaded (unmodified)**
    - **New File:** Nothing happens (inputs are the defaults already)
    - **Open:** Open a file dialog and let the user pick an existing file
        - **Open:** Open the chosen file and show its contents in the editor
        - **Cancel:** No action, back to the main window
    - **Save:** Open a file dialog to pick a filename and location
        - **Save:** Save contents to the chosen location and show them in the editor
        - **Cancel:** No action, back to the main window
    - **Save As:** Open a file dialog to pick a filename and location
